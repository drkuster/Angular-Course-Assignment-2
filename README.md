<p>The objective of this assignment is to practice string interpolation, property binding, event binding and 2 way data binding. The user is prompted to enter a username into the input field. When the input field is not empty, the "Clear Username" button becomes enabled. Clicking the "Clear Username" button does exactly what you think it would: the input field is cleared and the button once again becomes disabled.</p>
